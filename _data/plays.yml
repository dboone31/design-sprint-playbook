    ## Step-by-Step Process
    1. **Silent Writing (2-3 min):** Everyone writes ideas/answers silently on sticky notes
    2. **Silent Review (2-3 min):** Post notes, everyone reviews silently
    3. **Dot Voting (2-3 min):** Everyone votes with dots on preferred options
    4. **Decider's Call (1-2 min):** Decider makes final choice considering votes
    
    ## Required Materials
    - Sticky notes (different colors optional)
    - Pens for all participants
    - Dot stickers for voting
    - Wall space or large surface

    ## Purpose & Goals
    Gather inspiration from existing solutions across industries to inform solution design without copying directly.
    
    ## Step-by-Step Process
    1. **Research Phase (individual time):** Find examples of similar solutions from other companies/industries
    2. **Presentation (3 min each):** Show solution, explain what's interesting, avoid detailed critique
    3. **Note Taking:** Capture interesting patterns and approaches
    4. **Quick Synthesis:** Identify common themes and novel approaches
    
    ## Required Materials
    - Screen for presentations
    - Timer
    - Note-taking materials
    - Research examples prepared in advance

    ## Complete 90-Minute Breakdown
    
    ### Step 1: Notes (20 minutes)
    **Instruction:** Walk around room, copy down everything from walls (HMWs, goals, questions). No devices except for reference materials.
    **Purpose:** Gather all available information without filtering or judging
    **Tips:** Don't edit or organize - just capture everything that might be relevant
    
    ### Step 2: Ideas (20 minutes)
    **Instruction:** Based on notes, write rough ideas for elements of a solution. Aim for 20+ ideas.
    **Purpose:** Brain dump without commitment to any single direction
    **Format:** Bullet points, rough sketches, single words - whatever gets ideas out quickly
    
    ### Step 3: Crazy 8s (8 minutes)
    **Instruction:** Fold paper into 8 sections. Sketch 8 different ideas in 8 minutes (1 minute each)
    **Purpose:** Push beyond obvious solutions through time pressure
    **Rules:** Don't worry about details or beauty - focus on different approaches to core user need
    
    ### Step 4: Solution Sketch (30-45 minutes)
    **Instruction:** Create detailed 3-panel storyboard showing user's experience with your solution
    **Format:** Panel 1: Setup/context, Panel 2: Key interaction, Panel 3: Outcome/benefit
    **Detail Level:** Include enough detail that someone else could build from your sketch
    
    ## Required Materials
    - Large paper (11x17 recommended)
    - Sticky notes
    - Markers (multiple colors)
    - Timer

    ## Purpose & Goals
    Identify most interesting parts of solution concepts through silent, individual assessment before group discussion.
    
    ## Step-by-Step Process
    1. **Silent Review (5 min):** Walk around, review all solution sketches silently. No discussion or questions.
    2. **Dot Voting (3 min):** Place dots on interesting parts (not whole concepts). Use different colored dots for different criteria.
    3. **Pattern Recognition (2 min):** Identify patterns in voting, highlight popular areas and surprising results.
    
    ## Required Materials
    - Dot stickers (multiple colors)
    - Posted solution sketches
    - Wall space for easy viewing
    
    ## Voting Criteria Options
    - Most likely to delight users
    - Most technically feasible
    - Best addresses core problem
    - Most innovative approach
