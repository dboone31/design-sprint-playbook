      **Setup:** Timer, presentation space
      
      **Process:**
      1. Each key stakeholder gets 3 minutes to pitch their vision
      2. Focus on: problem, user, solution hypothesis, success metrics
      3. No questions or feedback during pitches
      4. Note commonalities and differences
      
      **Scoring Criteria:** Problem clarity, user focus, solution feasibility, metric definition

  - title: "5 Whys"
    duration: "25 minutes"
    description: "Drill down to root causes of the problem being solved."
    details: |
      **Example Chain:**
      1. Why do users struggle with our current workflow? → Too many steps
      2. Why are there too many steps? → Multiple disconnected systems
      3. Why weren't systems connected initially? → Different vendors, no integration plan
      4. Why was there no integration plan? → Requirements gathered in silos
      5. Why were requirements gathered in silos? → No cross-functional planning process
      
      **Output:** Root cause identification and validation opportunities

  - title: "Card Sorting"
    duration: "40 minutes"
    description: "Organize and prioritize features, assumptions, or user needs."
    details: |
      **Materials:** Index cards or digital cards, categories
      
      **Methodology:**
      1. Write each feature/assumption on individual cards (15 min)
      2. Create category groups (Must Have, Nice to Have, Out of Scope) (10 min)
      3. Have team members individually sort cards into categories (10 min)
      4. Discuss discrepancies and reach consensus (5 min)
      
      **Output:** Prioritized feature list and scope boundaries

      **Complete 90-Minute Breakdown:**
      
      **Step 1: Notes (20 minutes)**
      - **Instruction:** Walk around room, copy down everything from walls (HMWs, goals, questions). No devices except for reference materials.
      - **Purpose:** Gather all available information without filtering or judging
      - **Tips:** Don't edit or organize - just capture everything that might be relevant
      
      **Step 2: Ideas (20 minutes)**
      - **Instruction:** Based on notes, write rough ideas for elements of a solution. Aim for 20+ ideas.
      - **Purpose:** Brain dump without commitment to any single direction
      - **Format:** Bullet points, rough sketches, single words - whatever gets ideas out quickly
      
      **Step 3: Crazy 8s (8 minutes)**
      - **Instruction:** Fold paper into 8 sections. Sketch 8 different ideas in 8 minutes (1 minute each)
      - **Purpose:** Push beyond obvious solutions through time pressure
      - **Rules:** Don't worry about details or beauty - focus on different approaches to core user need
      
      **Step 4: Solution Sketch (30-45 minutes)**
      - **Instruction:** Create detailed 3-panel storyboard showing user's experience with your solution
      - **Format:** Panel 1: Setup/context, Panel 2: Key interaction, Panel 3: Outcome/benefit
      - **Detail Level:** Include enough detail that someone else could build from your sketch
      
      **Materials:** Large paper, sticky notes, markers, timer

  - title: "Lightning Demos"
    duration: "3 min each"
    description: "Quick demos of existing solutions for cross-industry inspiration and pattern recognition."
    details: |
      **Purpose & Goals**
      Gather inspiration from existing solutions across industries to inform solution design without copying directly.
      
      **Step-by-Step Process**
      1. **Research Phase (individual time):** Find examples of similar solutions from other companies/industries
      2. **Presentation (3 min each):** Show solution, explain what's interesting, avoid detailed critique
      3. **Note Taking:** Capture interesting patterns and approaches
      4. **Quick Synthesis:** Identify common themes and novel approaches

  - title: "Heat Map Voting"
    duration: "10 minutes"
    description: "Silent dot voting to identify areas of interest across solution sketches and concepts."
    details: |
      **Purpose & Goals**
      Identify most interesting parts of solution concepts through silent, individual assessment before group discussion.
      
      **Step-by-Step Process**
      1. **Silent Review (5 min):** Walk around, review all solution sketches silently. No discussion or questions.
      2. **Dot Voting (3 min):** Place dots on interesting parts (not whole concepts). Use different colored dots for different criteria.
      3. **Pattern Recognition (2 min):** Identify patterns in voting, highlight popular areas and surprising results.
